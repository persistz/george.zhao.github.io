Zhao Zhe (George) is a Research Engineer at 
<a href="https://www.real-ai.cn/">RealAI</a>, 
whose research interest lies in the area of 
trustworthy AI, software testing and verification, 
such as the robustness of large language models (LLMs), 
adversarial attack and defense, neural network testing, etc.
He received the PhD degree from System and Software Security Lab 
(<a href="https://s3l.shanghaitech.edu.cn/">S3L</a>) in School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech university,
under supervision of <a href="http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/songfu/">Prof. Song Fu</a>.
<!-- He received a bachelor degree from Ocean University of China in 2016, 
major in computer science. -->
<!-- then joint HP as an automation testing engineer 
until becoming a member of S3L. -->
<!-- His research interest lies in the area of trustworthy AI, program analysis and verification, 
such as adversarial attacks, neural network testing, etc. -->
<!-- He is currently doing research in defining code coverage metrics for GPU programs and automated test case generation, reduction and execution. --> 

<!-- **[Update!]** I am on the job market now, and looking for a job in the field of AI security. 如果您有合适的岗位，欢迎随时通过下方简历中的电话、邮件与我联系。
