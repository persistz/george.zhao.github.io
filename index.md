Zhao Zhe (George) is a fourth year PhD candidate at the System and Software Security Lab 
(<a href="https://s3l.shanghaitech.edu.cn/">S3L</a>) in School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech university. 
He received a bachelor degree from Ocean University of China in 2016, 
major in computer science.
<!-- then joint HP as an automation testing engineer 
until becoming a member of S3L. -->

His research interest lies in the area of trustworthy AI, program analysis and verification, 
such as adversarial attacks, neural network testing, etc.
<!-- He is currently doing research in defining code coverage metrics for GPU programs and automated test case generation, reduction and execution. --> 
His supervisor is <a href="http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/songfu/">Prof. Song Fu</a>.
